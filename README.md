# Macro-Word
Makros for set length and width the images in Microsoft Word. the macro was written for very old Microsoft Office version. I write 3 command in VBA to resize automatically images:
* set multiple images to fixed size
* Increase image size
* Decrease image size
In very old version Microsoft Word ( Microsoft Office XP)(all commands were hidden in the dropdown menus). Macros speed up my work with multiple images.

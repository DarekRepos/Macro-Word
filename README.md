# Macro-Word
Makros for set length and width the images in Microsoft Word. the macro was written for very old Microsoft Office version. I write 3 command in VBA to resize automatically images:

# Features:
* set multiple images to fixed size
* Increase image size
* Decrease image size

# Why this program?
Macro works in very old version Microsoft Word ( Microsoft Office XP).
All commands were hidden in drop-down menus and image editing was time consuming. Macros speed up my work with multiple images.
